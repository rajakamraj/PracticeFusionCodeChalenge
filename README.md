# PracticeFusionCodeChalenge

This project was created for Practice Fusion coding challenge.

Problem statement:

A site contains a listing of doctors. Users can browse for doctors given a specific specialty, area, review score etc.

You need to help write the logic for returning similar doctors.  Specifically, write a class(es) which when given a doctor, provides a list of similar doctors, in a prioritized order. You define what similar means and the result ordering but clearly document any assumptions in your code.  Please include unit tests. You can assume the entire directory of doctors fits into memory.  Write in whatever language you're most comfortable with. 

Aim to spend 30 minutes on this coding challenge. We are not expecting you to create an entire hosted site, just the class for the algorithm for finding similar doctors and associated unit tests. If applicable, note down any remaining thoughts or things you would want to improve on with more time. 

Please return the assignment by uploading a repo to github or bitbucket. For private repos let us know and we''ll provide an email. We don't accept zip drive submissions for security reasons.
